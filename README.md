## Personality Traits and Productivity – Regression Analysis

This project analyzes how individual personality traits impact productivity using a synthetic dataset of 20,000 records. We investigate whether emotional stability, stress handling, and collaborative work style can predict productivity using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Project Goals
- Perform **hypothesis testing** on an unused trait (`curiosity`) to assess its effect on productivity.
- Train a **Simple Linear Regression** model using 2–3 features.
- Analyze **R² score** and **homoscedasticity** through residual plots.
- Visualize key insights using histograms, pairplots, and residual distributions.

##  Key Methods
- T-Test for hypothesis testing
- Linear regression using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluation: R², MAE, RMSE
- Residual and actual vs. predicted plots

## Files Included
- `notebook.ipynb` – full analysis and visualizations
- `requirements.txt` – required Python packages
- `.gitignore` – ignored files (envs, logs, temp)
- `README.md` – project overview
